# Fortwars Redux
A Fortwars gamemode for Garry's Mod.

Based on an old gamemode I made a long time ago, updated to work with the current version of gmod and with some bug fixes and additions.

Unfinished but working, requires custom maps to work properly which did not currently exist. Alternatively, launch it on `gm_flatgrass` and run  `fw_makecores` .
