You're playing Fort Wars Redux!
This is an updated and reduxed port of an old gamemode by Catdaemon. This gamemode is also by Catdaemon.
The idea of this game mode is to build a superior base to the other team.
In the gamemode Fort Wars Teamplay, (fwt_ maps), you simply try to massacre the other team.
In the gamemode Fort Wars Core, (fwc_ maps), you have to destroy all of the enemy's cores to win.
Keep in mind that cores can take quite a beating before being destroyed.
Each team can have one or more cores, depending on the map!

There are two rounds:
BUILD - Construct your fort. Each player gets a limited number of spawns, so work together!
        Going out of your core's build radius will do damage to you, so stay close!
FIGHT - Fight! Weapon pickups are available.

TIPS:
- Run over weapon crates to get ammunition or guns.
- Shooting enemy walls enough will cause them to unfreeze and fall. After this, if shot more they will
     be destroyed.
- Pressing F1 gets rid of this screen.
- It is better to make a fort from lots of small props than few big props.
- Standing very close to turrets (or on top!) makes them unable to hit you.
- Shoot SMG grenades into confined spaces.
- The Item Ejector will annoy your enemy more if your teammates use their gravity guns...
- If you're given a turret, think about where you place it.
